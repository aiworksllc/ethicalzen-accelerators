ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The PCI compliance guardrail (financial_compliance_v1) is using pattern fallback
instead of ML-based detection. It only checks for financial advice keywords
("guaranteed", "risk-free", "insider") - NOT detecting account/card number patterns.

RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS for template/demo purposes
✅ Architecture and integration working correctly
✅ 80% test success rate
✅ LLM behaved responsibly in all cases

For production use:
- Enhance financial_compliance_v1 to detect account/card number patterns
- Add regex patterns for: account numbers, credit cards, routing numbers
- Re-test after guardrail enhancement
